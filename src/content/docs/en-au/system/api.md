title: API
description: Authentication, docs pages and limits.

ABM has a REST API under `/api`. The interactive reference is at `/api/docs` (Swagger) and `/api/redoc`, and the schema at `/api/openapi.json`. Set `DOCS_ENABLED=false` to remove all three. The docs pages load assets from a CDN, so they render fully only with internet access.

## Authenticating

Every call under `/api` needs the API key, the way Sonarr and Radarr work. That holds when you are signed in, on your own network, and in the None and local-address modes. Those only open the web interface, and the web app fetches the key itself and sends it on every call.

- **API key**: send `X-Api-Key: <key>` or `?apikey=<key>`. Find or regenerate it under **Settings > General > Security**. See [Security](/en-au/settings/security/).
- The live-update websocket needs the key too.
- Login tokens do not work on the API. An `Authorization: Bearer` token from signing in is refused, and login, setup and saving the security settings no longer return `access_token`. The sign-in cookie only opens the web interface.
- `GET /api/system/status` with your key is the quickest way to test it. A missing or wrong key is a 401.
- Covers, backup downloads and log downloads are not under `/api` any more: `/media-cover/...`, `/backup/{file}` and `/logfile`. They open with your sign-in or with the key.
- Under Basic, the web interface takes the Basic credentials, and `POST /api/auth/login` answers 409. The API still takes the key.

## Conventions

- Errors come back as `{"detail": ...}`.
- Secrets are never returned. A response says whether one is set.
- A state-changing browser request needs a matching origin. Scripts using a key are exempt.
- Request bodies are capped at 10 MiB (`MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES`). Backup restore and cover upload have larger limits. Over the cap is HTTP 413.
- Validation errors never echo back what you sent.

## Metadata outages

A book search that gets no answer from Libex returns 502 with "Libex search failed". An author or series search returns 503 with "Libex could not be reached; try again shortly". Some lookup routes still return an empty result in an outage.

If you know Sonarr: the API is not v3-compatible. Prowlarr can sync indexers into ABM through its Prowlarr connection.
